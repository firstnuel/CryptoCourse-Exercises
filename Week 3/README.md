# Week 3: Stream ciphers and hash functions

### Task 1: Stream cipher usage

Task 1.1
- The ciphertext for "Move the chairs to the house as soon as possible!" that will decrypt to the desired plaintext under the same keystream used for "Move the tables to the patio as soon as possible!" is:

  a7896ad1b2f7da8d40a434173df74a839a88b5c9a97625e65e16bfebfb542072595d804d5ad1a3af11ea7244a39d76cde1

- Code used
   ````py
   # Original and desired plaintexts
  original_plaintext = "Move the tables to the patio as soon as possible!"
  desired_plaintext = "Move the chairs to the house as soon as possible!"
  
  # Provided ciphertext for the original plaintext
  original_ciphertext_hex = "a7896ad1b2f7da8d40b33d1438e04a839a88b5c9a97625fe5017a5e1fb542072595d804d5ad1a3af11ea7244a39d76cde1"
  
  # Convert hex ciphertext to bytes
  original_ciphertext_bytes = bytes.fromhex(original_ciphertext_hex)
  
  # Function to XOR two byte sequences
  def xor_bytes(byte_seq1, byte_seq2):
      return bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(byte_seq1, byte_seq2))
  
  # Generating the keystream by XORing the original plaintext with its ciphertext
  keystream = xor_bytes(original_plaintext.encode(), original_ciphertext_bytes)
  
  # Encrypting the desired plaintext with the keystream
  desired_ciphertext_bytes = xor_bytes(desired_plaintext.encode(), keystream)
  
  # Converting the desired ciphertext to hexadecimal representation
  desired_ciphertext_hex = desired_ciphertext_bytes.hex()
  
  desired_ciphertext_hex
   
  ````


- This ciphertext was generated by XORing the desired plaintext with the keystream derived from the original plaintext and its provided ciphertext. Notice that the beginning and ending parts of the ciphertext are the same for both messages. This similarity occurs because the same segments of plaintext ("Move the" and "as soon as possible!") were encrypted with the same part of the keystream.
